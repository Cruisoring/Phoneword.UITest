Phoneword.UITest
================

The sample project demonstrates how to build Automation tests with Xamarin.UITest 
against the Phoneword apps build with Xamarin.Forms.

The app by itself is to convert telephone number 'words' into digits (eg 1-800-FLOWERS to the actual phone number).

The test app would enter a string of phone word, click the 'Translate' button, validate it is converted to a string of numbers before clicking it, and finally dismiss the dialog by clicking the 'No' button.
